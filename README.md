## 👤 About me

I’m Ferran — I like building small, focused things:

- client websites for local businesses  
- guides & tools for my own nerdy interests (retro / gaming / PSO etc.)  
- lots of school assignments in different languages that somehow still live here 😅  

If you see anything interesting:  
- Feel free to open an issue, fork it, or ping me.  
- Or just **steal the ideas** and make them better.
